This is a working repository for RELEASE 3 of the Marpa.  This is
beta software.  It has a CPAN-based installation procedure.

Within Marpa::R3 may be several development directories.  These are
not needed to build & install Marpa::R3, or even to do much of the
development.  These do not have stable, fully documented installation
procedures.
