Marpa::R2::Acknowledgements - Marpa acknowledgements

=head1 Acknowledgements

Marpa is
directly derived from two other parsers.
The first was discovered by
John Aycock and
R.  Nigel Horspool
and is described in their
L<Aycock and Horspool 2002|Marpa::R2::Advanced::Bibliography/"Aycock and Horspool 2002">.
The second was described by Joop Leo and is described in
L<Leo 1991|Marpa::R2::Advanced::Bibliography/"Leo 1991">.
Aycock, Horspool, and Leo, in turn, based their
algorithms on the
L<algorithm discovered by Jay Earley|Marpa::R2::Advanced::Bibliography/"Earley 1970">.
I combined the Aycock-Horspool algorithm with the Leo algorithm,
and added significant changes of my own.

I'm grateful to Randal Schwartz for his support over the years that
I've been working on Marpa.
My chats with
Larry Wall have been few and brief,
but his openness to new ideas has been
a major encouragement
and his insight into the relationship between
"natural language" and computer language
has been a major influence.
More recently,
Allison Randal and Patrick Michaud have been generous with their
very valuable time.
They might have preferred that I volunteered as a Parrot cage-cleaner,
but if so, they were too polite to say.

Many at perlmonks.org answered questions for me.
I used answers from
chromatic, Corion, dragonchild,
jdporter, samtregar and Juerd,
among others,
in writing this module.
I'm just as grateful to those whose answers I didn't use.
My inquiries were made while I was thinking out the code and
it wasn't always 100% clear what I was after.
If the butt is moved after the round,
it shouldn't count against the archer.

In writing the Pure Perl version of Marpa, I benefited from studying
the work of Francois Desarmenien (C<Parse::Yapp>),
Damian Conway (C<Parse::RecDescent>) and
Graham Barr (C<Scalar::Util>).
Adam Kennedy patiently instructed me
in module writing,
both on the finer points and
on issues about which I really should have know better.

I am very grateful to Ruslan Zakirov for generously
starting, and agreeing to moderate,
the "Marpa parser" mailing list.
It is hard to describe how important
informed and constructive feedback 
is to a lone laborer on
a complex and large project like Marpa,
and I greatly appreciate all the
contributors to the list.
In addition to Ruslan,
Peter Stuifzand and Ron Savage stand out
for their contributions.
I am especially grateful to Ron,
who has been a very aggressive early adopter
of all Marpa's versions.

For the Windows port of Marpa,
I am indebted to the work of Jean-Damien Durand.
