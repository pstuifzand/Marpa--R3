Marpa::R2::Semantics::Phases - Details of parse evaluation

=head1 Overview of the semantic phases

Most users will not need to read this document.
Most applications will find that the order in which
Marpa executes its semantics "just works".
This document describes that order in detail.
These details can matter in some applications,
for example, those which exploit side effects.
And some readers may also find this background material
to be helpful.

=head1 Parse trees, parse results and parse series

As a reminder,
when the semantics are applied to a parse tree,
they produce a value called a B<parse result>.
Because Marpa allows ambiguous parsing,
each parse can produce a B<parse series> --
a series of zero or more parse trees,
each with its own parse result.
The first call to the
L<the recognizer's C<value>
method|Marpa::R2::Recognizer/"value">
after the recognizer is created is the
start of the first parse series.
The first parse series continues until there is
a call to the
L<the C<reset_evaluation>
method|Marpa::R2::Recognizer/"reset_evaluation">
or until the recognizer is destroyed.
Usually, an application is only interested in a single
parse series.

When the
L<C<reset_evaluation>|Marpa::R2::Recognizer/"reset_evaluation">
method
is called
for a recognizer, it begins a new parse series.
The new parse series continues until
there is another
call to the
L<the C<reset_evaluation>
method|Marpa::R2::Recognizer/"reset_evaluation">,
or until the recognizer is destroyed.

=head1 Summary of the phases

While processing a parse series, we have:

=over

=item * A Series Setup Phase, which occurs during
the first call of the recognizer's C<value> method
for that series.
It is followed by

=item * the processing of zero or more parse trees.

=back

While processing a parse tree, we have:

=over

=item * A Tree Setup Phase, which occurs during
the call of the recognizer's C<value> method
for that parse tree.
It is followed by

=item * a Tree Traveral Phase.

=back

B<Node Evaluation Time>
is the Tree Traversal Phase, as seen from the point of view of
each rule node.  It is not a separate phase.

=head1 Series Setup Phase

During the Series Setup Phase
all value action names are resolved to
value actions --
constants
or rule evaluation closures.
The rule evaluation closures are never called in the Series Setup Phase.
They will be called later,
in the Tree Traversal Phase.
Also, during the Series Setup Phase,
the logic which
ranks parse trees is executed.

=head1 Tree Setup Phase

In the Tree Setup Phase,
the per-parse-tree variable is created.
If a constructor was found for the C<action_object>,
it is run at this point, and the per-parse-tree variable is
its return value.
Exactly one Tree Setup Phase occurs
for each parse tree.

=head1 Tree Traversal Phase

During the Tree Traversal Phase,
the rule evaluation closures are called.
Node Evaluation Time is the Tree Traversal Phase,
as seen from the point of view of the individual nodes of the parse tree.
